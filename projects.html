     <h4>Hi</h4>
     <h2>Desk Lamp: 2017</h2>
<p> Jr.  innovation lab was given the assignment to create a desk lamp that fits in a box that is 12x12x24. We had less than a week to find 15 ideas for your lamp.  I found a lot more, when I saw that some were too easy to create I started taking them out of the picture. When I had come to at least five, I turned to my friends and family. After that I had broken it down to two. One was a wooden triangle with a shade hanging from the top (which of course I would change.) The other one is pretty much the one I did use, it was a circle with round arms surrounding a bulb. The arms and metal bars going through it. When I started building it I showed it to Mulhern, (I was going to have 4 legs and 6 arms) he suggested having the arms and legs as one piece which taught me to make things easier if possible. When I was done designing all of the pieces to scale, I started with the wooden base made out of mahogany because I wanted my room to smell like the wood. When I was finished with that I started cutting the arms and legs, I thought I was just going to cut them with two layers of wood, and doing that three times but Mulhern again made it easier and I cut with three layers, only twice. When I was done cutting them I took a chisel and hammer and cut out a small hole so I could fit the base into the hole. After that I sanded the arms and legs with the belt sander which took a while due to a little nub sticking out so I had to use another type of power sander and multiple hand sanders, but I got it out. Now I just have to drill some hole, put the pieces together, solder the light, and attach the light.
