      <h1>NYC Trip to NBC Studios and Youtube Spaces</h1>
      <p>I really enjoyed my time at NBC Studios and at YouTube Space. The memorial at NBC studios showed me that they really respected their families and friends. NBC Studios also really immersed the tourists into the tour really well, by having us recorded and pretending to me Olympians. They also had many pictures on the walls showing us through the history of NBC Studios which was cool. YouTube Spaces was located in an odd spot, above a market. When we got off the bus I thought we were having a snack or early dinner but then they showed us the elevator. It was awesome to be in a YouTube facility. I saw a YouTuber there that I knew which made the experience so much better. It was also cool to see all of their tech, such as the V.R., hologram, and face generator. It was surprising to me what they did there and why YouTubers go there, they help the YouTubers add to their subscriber number. Some differences I noticed was that at NBC Studios it felt more official than at YouTube Spaces, but on the other hand YouTube was a bit more interactive. Some similarities I noticed was that of course they both had some interactive moment. They also had new, and big cameras, technology, and other equipment.
